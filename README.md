# Hello World - Defold Project-X 2019

Hello World is a Swedish non-profit organization that arranges meet-ups and summer camps with the goal to teach children aged 8-18 about natural science, technology, innovation and art using digital tools. King and Defold are proud sponsors since 2016 where we have been involved in the shaping curriculum of the Defold track at the summer camp. Project X is our contribution to the Studio X track of the summer camp where children with prior experience of Defold and programming languages are faced with harder problems to solve.

## Goal
The goal of the Project-X 2019 challenge is to add the missing mechanics to several small mini-games so that they are playable from start to finish.

## Rules
You are only allowed to modify the files in each level folder. Modifying files outside of the level folder is considered cheating.
